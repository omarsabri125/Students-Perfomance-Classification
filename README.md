# Students Performance Classification
**Author:** Omar Ahmed Sabri
## Overview
This notebook provides an analysis and classification of students' performance based on various factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, and test preparation course. The primary goal is to build a classification model to predict students' performance levels.

## Contents
The notebook contains the following sections:

1. **Introduction**
   - Description of the dataset and its attributes
   - Objective of the analysis

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loading the dataset
   - Data cleaning and handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Statistical summary of the data
   - Visualization of data distributions and relationships

4. **Model Building**
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets
   - Training various classification models
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Comparing the performance of different models
   - Selecting the best model based on evaluation metrics

6. **Conclusion**
   - Summary of findings
   - Future work and improvements

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following attributes:

- **gender**: Gender of the student
- **race/ethnicity**: Race/ethnicity group of the student
- **parental level of education**: Highest level of education attained by the student's parents
- **lunch**: Type of lunch the student receives (standard or free/reduced)
- **test preparation course**: Whether the student completed a test preparation course
- **math score**: Math score of the student
- **reading score**: Reading score of the student
- **writing score**: Writing score of the student

## Results
The notebook includes a detailed analysis of the students' performance and builds a classification model to predict performance levels. The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics, and its performance is summarized in the conclusion section.
